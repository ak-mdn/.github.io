                                        Blending a passion for both technology and business management, I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science with Management at Queen Mary University of London. My academic journey is defined by a strong work ethic and adaptability, allowing me to quickly grasp complex concepts and excel in my studies.

                                        Having entered university as a mature student, I bring a heightened sense of seriousness and discipline to my academic pursuits. My experiences as a self-employed individual have further developed my self-management skills, instilling a sense of responsibility and independence that drives my approach to learning and personal growth.

                                <p>
                                        I am deeply interested in understanding how technology and business intersect, believing that the future of innovation lies in the seamless integration of these two fields. My goal is to leverage my technical skills and management insights to make meaningful contributions in this evolving landscape.

                                <p>
                                        In addition to my studies, I am actively seeking summer internships to apply my growing knowledge and enhance my skills in various tech or business domains. I am eager to engage in real-world applications of my learning, preparing myself for a successful and impactful career in the tech industry. My journey is one of continuous growth, and I am excited to see where this path will lead me.
