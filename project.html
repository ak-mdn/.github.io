                                <p>As part of a team consultancy project at Queen Mary University of London, we focused on enhancing the operations of a UK-based charity that leverages football for charitable purposes in The Gambia. Our research and data gathering efforts identified the organization’s strengths and weaknesses, with a particular emphasis on youth development and charitable activities. Additionally, we addressed the issue of illegal migration by raising awareness and proposing outreach solutions. Our collective analysis produced actionable recommendations, offering a deeper understanding of how sports can be used for social causes.</p>

                                <p>This project, completed at Ealing, Hammersmith and West London College, involved the development of a database system for a General Practitioner in Hammersmith. The process was divided into three key phases. The first, the System Analysis Phase, focused on understanding the specific database needs, which led to the creation of Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) and Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs). The Database Design Phase utilized Microsoft Access to build a user-friendly and efficient database system. Finally, the Database Project Development Phase implemented and tested the database system, ensuring its functionality in a real-world healthcare setting.</p>
